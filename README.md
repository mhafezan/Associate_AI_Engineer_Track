- Web search tool: Produces a `web_search_call` when current online information is needed
- Travel guardrails: Encourages confirmation of important requirements with official authorities before booking or departure
- Model compatibility: Uses the model's default sampling because `temperature` is not supported

## Module 4: Embeddings and Semantic Search

[`4_Embedding/Semantic_Search_Engine.py`](4_Embedding/Semantic_Search_Engine.py) implements an interactive product search engine using embeddings and cosine distance. It retrieves products without RAG or generated answers.

### Data and workflow

1. `load_products` downloads the first 1,000 usable products by default from the training split of the [Shopify product catalogue](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Shopify/product-catalogue). It maps titles, descriptions, categories, and brands into `products` dictionaries. Descriptions are capped at 2,000 characters; brands are stored in `features`.
2. `create_product_text` combines those fields into `product_texts`.
3. `create_embeddings` creates `product_embeddings` with `text-embedding-3-small`. Requests are limited to 64 inputs and 24,000 tokens; individual inputs over 8,191 tokens are rejected.
4. Each user-entered `query_text` is embedded into `query_vector`.
5. `find_n_closest` returns the five nearest products as `hits`, preserving their `index` and cosine `distance`. Results display titles, categories, descriptions, brands, and distances.
6. The loop accepts another query until `exit` is entered, ignoring case and surrounding whitespace. Blank queries are skipped; Ctrl+C and EOF also exit.

### Setup and run on Windows

Run these commands from the **repository root** using a standard Windows Python installation with `venv` support:

```powershell
python -m venv .\4_Embedding\.venv
.\4_Embedding\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pip install numpy openai tiktoken
$env:OPENAI_API_KEY = "your-api-key"
.\4_Embedding\.venv\Scripts\python.exe .\4_Embedding\Semantic_Search_Engine.py
```

If the virtual environment already exists, skip its creation. No `requirements.txt` is needed. Use the same virtual-environment interpreter for installation and execution: plain `python` or `python3` may resolve to another installation and cause `ModuleNotFoundError` for `numpy` or `tiktoken`.

From **inside `4_Embedding`**, run:

```powershell
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pip install numpy openai tiktoken
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe .\Semantic_Search_Engine.py
```

To index more products, add `--limit 5000` (minimum: 5). Example queries include `a gift for someone who enjoys gardening` and `a lightweight summer hat`.

### Caching and limitations

Product metadata and embeddings are saved in `4_Embedding/.semantic_search_cache/`, which is excluded from Git along with `.venv/` and `__pycache__/`. Embedding cache keys include the model and ordered product texts. Cached vectors are reused on later runs; each nonempty search still calls the OpenAI embeddings API. Initial indexing and query embedding incur API charges.

Search covers only the loaded catalogue sample, which is multilingual and is not live inventory. Lower cosine distance indicates greater similarity, not a confidence probability. The engine returns five results even when all matches are weak. To refresh downloaded metadata, remove the relevant `shopify_train_<limit>_v1.json` cache file; embeddings are rebuilt if the resulting texts change.

```powershell
setx OPENAI_API_KEY "sk-your-api-key-here"
```

#### Windows (Command Prompt)

```cmd
setx OPENAI_API_KEY "sk-your-api-key-here"
```

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-your-api-key-here"
```

To make it permanent, add to `~/.bash_profile` or `~/.zshrc`:
```bash
echo 'export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-your-api-key-here"' >> ~/.bash_profile
source ~/.bash_profile
```
